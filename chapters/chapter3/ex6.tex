\subsection{High Pass Filter}
In contrast to the low pass filter, there is a high pass filter, which can be referred from this
link: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/video-tutorials/op-amps-low-pass-and-high-pass

Students are proposed to implement a high pass filter in PSPICE and explain the
behaviors of your high pass filter.
